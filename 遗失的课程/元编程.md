### 什么是元编程
---
遗失的课程中的元编程更多的是方便编程的工具的使用像 Makefile这些。

**Metaprogramming** is a programming technique in which computer programs have the ability to **treat other programs as their data**. 

It means that a program can be designed to **read, generate, analyze or transform other programs**, and even modify itself while running.

优点：
1. In some cases, this allows programmers to **minimize the number of lines of code to express a solution**, in turn reducing development time

2. It also allows programs a **greater flexibility to efficiently** handle new situations without recompilation.

Metaprogramming can be used to **move computations from run-time to compile-time**, to generate code using compile time computations, and to enable self-modifying code.
