### How do you quantify a password is more secure than other one

Entropy(ç†µ) is mearsured in bits, and when selecting uniformly at random from a set of possible outcomes, the entropy is equal to `log_2(# of possibilitiess)`.
A fair coin flip gives 1 bit of entropy. A dice roll (of a 6-sided die) has ~2.58 bits of entropy.

How many bits of entropy is enough? It depends on your threat model. For online guessing, as the XKCD comic points out, ~40 bits of entropy is pretty good. To be resistant to offline guessing, a stronger password would be necessary (e.g. 80 bits, or more).
