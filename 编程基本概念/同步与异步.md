### 异步为什么可以不需要线程
---
Asynchronous programming is particularly useful when dealing with operations that involve waiting for I/O (input/output) or network requests to complete. These operations typically involve waiting for external resources to become available, such as reading data from a database, fetching data from an API, or writing data to a file. 

While these operations are being performed, the CPU is not actively processing them. Instead, it can switch to other tasks or continue executing other code that does not depend on the completion of these operations. By using asynchronous programming, you can make sure that your code is not blocked and can continue to execute while waiting for these operations to complete. 

In summary, asynchronous programming is a technique that allows your code to continue executing while waiting for non-CPU-bound operations, such as I/O or network requests, to complete. This can help improve the responsiveness and performance of your code.

posix.1严格定义的[异步IO](https://www.zhihu.com/search?q=%E5%BC%82%E6%AD%A5IO&search_source=Entity&hybrid_search_source=Entity&hybrid_search_extra=%7B%22sourceType%22%3A%22answer%22%2C%22sourceId%22%3A14413599%7D)是要求没有任何一点阻塞，而上述的前面四个（阻塞IO，非阻塞IO，IO复用，信号驱动）都不同程度阻塞了，而且都有一个共同的阻塞： 内核拷贝数据到进程空间的这段时间需要等待。

对unix来讲：阻塞式I/O(默认)，非阻塞式I/O(nonblock)，I/O复用(select/poll/epoll)都属于同步I/O，因为它们在数据由内核空间复制回进程缓冲区时都是阻塞的(不能干别的事)。只有异步I/O模型(AIO)是符合异步I/O操作的含义的，即在1数据准备完成、2由内核空间拷贝回缓冲区后 通知进程，在等待通知的这段时间里可以干别的事。
