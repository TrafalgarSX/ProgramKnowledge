### 异步为什么可以不需要线程
---
Asynchronous programming is particularly useful when dealing with operations that involve waiting for I/O (input/output) or network requests to complete. These operations typically involve waiting for external resources to become available, such as reading data from a database, fetching data from an API, or writing data to a file. 

While these operations are being performed, the CPU is not actively processing them. Instead, it can switch to other tasks or continue executing other code that does not depend on the completion of these operations. By using asynchronous programming, you can make sure that your code is not blocked and can continue to execute while waiting for these operations to complete. 

In summary, asynchronous programming is a technique that allows your code to continue executing while waiting for non-CPU-bound operations, such as I/O or network requests, to complete. This can help improve the responsiveness and performance of your code.
