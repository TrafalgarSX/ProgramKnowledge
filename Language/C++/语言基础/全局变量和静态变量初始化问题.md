## 全局变量、static变量初始化时间

### [静态局部变量](https://so.csdn.net/so/search?q=%E9%9D%99%E6%80%81%E5%B1%80%E9%83%A8%E5%8F%98%E9%87%8F&spm=1001.2101.3001.7020)

首先，静态局部变量和全局变量一样，数据都存放在全局区域，所以在主程序之前，编译器已经为其分配好了内存，但在C和C++中静态局部变量的初始化节点又有点不太一样。

- 在C中，初始化发生在代码执行之前，编译阶段分配好内存之后，就会进行初始化，所以我们看到**在C语言中无法使用变量对静态局部变量进行初始化**，在程序运行结束，变量所处的全局内存会被全部回收。

- 而在C++中，初始化时在执行相关代码时才会进行初始化(❗**感觉不完全对**)，主要是由于C++引入对象后，要进行初始化必须执行相应构造函数和[析构函数](https://so.csdn.net/so/search?q=%E6%9E%90%E6%9E%84%E5%87%BD%E6%95%B0&spm=1001.2101.3001.7020)，在构造函数或析构函数中经常会需要进行某些程序中需要进行的特定操作，并非简单地分配内存。所以C++标准定为全局或静态对象是有首次用到时才会进行构造，并通过atexit()来管理。在程序结束，按照构造顺序反方向进行逐个析构。所以**在C++中是可以使用变量对静态局部变量进行初始化**的。

- 全局变量、文件域的静态变量和类的静态成员变量在**main执行之前**的静态初始化过程中分配内存并初始化；

- 局部静态变量（一般为函数内的静态变量）在第一次使用时分配内存并初始化。这里的变量包含内置数据类型和自定义类型的对象。**

### 全局变量

根据 C++ 标准，**全局变量的初始化要在 main 函数执行前完成**，常识无疑，但是这个说法有点含糊，main 函数执行前到底具体是什么时候呢？是编译时还是运行时？**答案是既有编译时，也可能会有运行时(seriously)**, 从语言的层面来说，全局变量的初始化可以划分为以下**两个阶段**（c++11 N3690 3.6.2)：

### The Two Stages of Static Variable Initialization
As discussed, variables with _static storage duration_ must be initialized once **before the program starts and destroyed after execution terminates**. Initialization of static variables should be simple, but off course it isn’t. And, as always, you can do a lot of self damage if you are not careful.

Initialization of static variables happens in two consecutive stages: 

- _static_ initialization
- _dynamic_ initialization.

**Static initialization** happens first and usually at **compile time**. If possible, initial values for static variables are **evaluated during compilation and burned into the data section of the executable（初始值写在文件中）**. Zero runtime overhead, early problem diagnosis, and, as we will see later, safe. This is called [constant initialization](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/constant_initialization). In an ideal world all static variables are const-initialized.

If the initial value of a static variable **can’t be evaluated at compile time**, the compiler will perform **zero-initialization**. 
💡Hence, during static initialization all static variables are **either const-initialized or zero-initialized.**

在静态初始化期间，所有静态变量要么被**常量初始化**，要么被**零初始化**。

**After static initialization**, **dynamic initialization** takes place. Dynamic initialization happens **at runtime** for variables that can’t be evaluated at compile time[2](https://pabloariasal.github.io/2020/01/02/static-variable-initialization/#fn:1). Here, static variables are initialized every time the executable is run and not just once during compilation.

### Constant Initialization
**Constant initialization (i.e. compile time)** is ideal, that’s why your compiler will try to perform it whenever it can. This is the case when your variable is initialized by a [constant expression](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/constant_expression), that is, an expression that can be evaluated at compile time.

```cpp
//a.cpp
struct MyStruct
{
    static int a;
};
int MyStruct::a = 67;

```

### Force Const Initialization with constexpr
❓**One big problem with static variable initialization** is that it is not always clear if a variable is being initialized at compile time or at runtime.

One way to make sure that variables are const-initialized (i.e. compile time) is by declaring them `constexpr`, **this will force the compiler to treat them as constant expressions and perform their evaluation and initialization at compile time.**

`constexpr` must be your first choice when declaring global variables (assuming you really need a global state to begin with). `constexpr` variables are not just initialized at compile time, but `constexpr` implies `const` and immutable state is always the right way.

### Your Second Line of Defense: `constinit`

`constinit` is a keyword introduced in the c++20 standard. It works just as `constexpr`, as it forces the compiler to evaluate a variable at compile time, but with the difference that it **doesn’t imply const**.

As a consequence, variables declared `constinit` are always const-(or zero-)initialized, but can be mutated at runtime, i.e. don’t land in read-only data section in the binary.

### The Yellow Zone - Dynamic Initialization
Imagine you need an immutable global `std::string` to store the software version. You probably don’t want this object to be instantiated every time the program runs, but rather create it once and embed it into the executable as read-only memory. In other words, you want `constexpr`:

```cpp
constexpr auto VERSION = std::string("3.4.1");
```

But life isn’t that easy:
```
error: constexpr variable cannot have non-literal type
```

❓TODO what is non-trivial destructor ?
The compiler is complaining because `std::string` defines a **non-trivial destructor**. That means that `std::string` is probably **allocating some resource that must be freed upon destruction**, in this case memory. This is a problem, if we create an `std::string` at compile time the managed memory must be somehow copied into the binary as well, as it won’t be available when the executable is run!

In other words, `std::string("3.4.1")` is not a constant expression so we can’t force the compiler to const-initialize it!

We must give up:
```cpp
const auto VERSION = std::string("3.4.1");
```

Your compiler is happy, but for **the price of moving the initialization from compile time to runtime**. `VERSION` must be initialized as part of dynamic initialization, not static.

Good news is that at runtime we can allocate memory. Bad news is that this **isn’t as nice, saf, or efficient** as static initialization, but isn’t inherently bad either. 

Dynamic initialization will be **inevitable** in some cases, **not everything can be done at compile time**, for example:

```cpp
// generate a random number every time executable is run
const auto RANDOM = generateRandomNumber();
```

The future looks bright, however. Even when moving slowly, **smart people have been working on several proposals to augment the capabilities of `constexpr` to types like `std::string` or `std::vector`**. The idea here is to allow for memory allocations at compile time and later flash the object alongside its managed memory into the data section of the binary.

### The Red Zone - Static Initialization Order Fiasco
Dynamic initialization of static variables suffers from a very scary defect: the order in which variables are initialized at runtime is not always well-defined.

Within a **single compilation unit**, static variables are initialized **in the same order as they are defined** in the source (this is called _Ordered Dynamic Initialization_). 

**Across compilation units**, however, the order is undefined: **you don’t know** if a static variable defined in `a.cpp` will be initialized before or after one in `b.cpp`.

This turns into a very serious issue if the initialization of a variable in `a.cpp` depends on another one defined `b.cpp` . This is called the [Static Initialization Order Fiasco](https://isocpp.org/wiki/faq/ctors#static-init-order). Consider this example:

```cpp
// a.cpp
int duplicate(int n)
{
    return n * 2;
}
auto A = duplicate(7); // A is dynamic-initialized
```

```cpp
// b.cpp
#include <iostream>

extern int A;
auto B = A; // dynamic initialized

int main()
{
  std::cout << B << std::endl;
  return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```

This program is ill-formed. It may print `14` or `0` (all static variables are at least zero-initialized during static initialization), depending if the dynamic initialization of `A` happens before `B` or not.

💡Note that **this problem can only happen during the dynamic initialization phase and not during static initialization**, (解释：)as during compile time it is impossible to access a value defined in another compilation unit. This makes compile time initialization so **much safer** than dynamic initialization, as it doesn’t suffer from the static initialization order fiasco.

### Solving The Static Initialization Order Fiasco
Encountering the static initialization order fiasco is **often a symptom of poor software design**. IMHO the best way to solve it is by refactoring the code to break the initialization dependency of globals across compilation units. **Make your modules self-contained and strive for constant initialization.**

If refactoring is not an option, one common solution is the [Initialization On First Use](https://isocpp.org/wiki/faq/ctors#static-init-order-on-first-use). The basic idea is to design your static variables that are not constant expressions (i.e. those that must be initialized at runtime) in a way that they are created _when they are accessed for the first time_. This approach uses a static local variable inspired by the [Meyer’s Singleton](http://laristra.github.io/flecsi/src/developer-guide/patterns/meyers_singleton.html). With this strategy it is possible to control the time when static variables are initialized at runtime, **avoiding use-before-init.**


```cpp
// a.cpp
int duplicate(int n)
{
    return n * 2;
}

auto& A()
{
  static auto a = duplicate(7); // Initiliazed first time A() is called
  return a;
}

```

```cpp
// b.cpp
#include <iostream>
#include "a.h"

auto B = A();

int main()
{
  std::cout << B << std::endl;
  return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}

```
