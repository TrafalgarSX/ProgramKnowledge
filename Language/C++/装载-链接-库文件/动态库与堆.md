每个 CRT 都有自己的堆管理器
[[跨CRT边界传递 CRT 对象可能的错误]]

[runtime运行时库在MT与MD之间的差别 - Development - Technology | Coneco = Welcome to coneco's study room](https://conecoy.cn/Technology/Development/runtime%E8%BF%90%E8%A1%8C%E6%97%B6%E5%BA%93%E5%9C%A8MT%E4%B8%8EMD%E4%B9%8B%E9%97%B4%E7%9A%84%E5%B7%AE%E5%88%AB/)

很多都说是有自己的堆， 上面的文章说不是， 指出是有不同的堆管理器， 我倾向于后者。

不同的 CRT 实例肯定是有不同的堆管理器的， (这算不算实际上的不同的堆？)
```markdown
Every executable image (EXE or DLL) can have its own statically linked CRT, or can dynamically link to a CRT. The version of the CRT statically included in or dynamically loaded by a particular image depends on the version of the tools and libraries it was built with. A single process may load multiple EXE and DLL images, each with its own CRT. **Each of those CRTs may use a different allocator, may have different internal structure layouts, and may use different storage arrangements. This means allocated memory, CRT resources, or classes passed across a DLL boundary can cause problems in memory management, internal static usage, or layout interpretation.** For example, if a class is allocated in one DLL but passed to and deleted by another, which CRT deallocator is used? The errors caused can range from the subtle to the immediately fatal, and therefore direct transfer of such resources is strongly discouraged.

#### DLL 有自己的堆吗？

[Answers to a customer's questions about memory and DLLs - The Old New Thing](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20161209-00/?p=94905)

这里回答里说(决定权在DLL， DLL 可以用已有的，也可以有自己的，看情况):
```markdown
**It is up to the DLL whether it wants to create its own heap, or whether it wants to use an existing heap.** In fact, a DLL doesn’t need to be consistent in its decision. It could use its own heap for some things and an existing heap for other things.
```

某些情况下可以跨DLL对内存进行分配和释放
```markdown
If a DLL wants to interoperate with other DLLs, and it wants to be able to allocate and free memory across DLL boundaries, then the two DLLs need to agree on which heap the memory should be allocated from and freed to. **One way of doing this is to choose an existing external heap and have both parties agree to use that. You see this, for example, with COM interfaces, which all agree to use the COM task allocator to allocate and free memory across COM object boundaries.** Memory returned by a COM method must be allocated from the COM task allocator (usually by calling `Co­Task­Mem­Alloc`), and that memory must then be freed to the COM task allocator (usually by calling `Co­Task­Mem­Free`).¹
```

尽量让每个库（模块）负责分配、管理和释放自己的对象， FILE*  std::string 带资源的类(包括分配内存) 等都应该要自己管理。在模块间传递像 std::string vector 带资源的类 也很可能出现错误。
```markdown
The last detail is something people often overlook. **They will create two modules which do not share the same instance of the C runtime, either because one or both linked the C runtime statically, or because the two both linked to different versions of the C runtime.** If you are in either of these cases, then you cannot share C runtime data structures between the two modules because the two modules are using different C runtimes. **This means that you cannot pass a `FILE*` between modules, you cannot pass a `std::string` between modules, and you cannot even pass a file descriptor between modules, because even though file descriptors are integers, they are integers that are managed by the corresponding C runtime library.**
```

静态链接（/MT）运行时库肯定使用的不是一个 CRT 实例， 动态链接 /MD， 可能是一个实例，也可能不是（版本是否相同决定或者说 一个用 debug 版本的， 另一个不是
```markdown
If you use malloc or new, then you are calling the corresponding function in the C runtime library that your module has chosen. In the case where you statically linked the C runtime, this is definitely not the same instance of the C runtime that anybody else is using, so that memory can be freed only by your module. In the case where you dynamically linked the C runtime, then this might or might not be the same instance of the C runtime that another module is using. **Only if the other module is indeed using the same version of the same C runtime library will it be able to free the memory with the corresponding free or delete function.**

```

    // vec3.reserve(3);  // 提前分配空间， 就不会在 DLL 中分配空间，从而不会出错

### Linux
####  Do shared libraries use the same heap as the application?


[c - Do shared libraries use the same heap as the application? - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8866790/do-shared-libraries-use-the-same-heap-as-the-application)

重点摘要：

If the library uses the same `malloc/free` as the application (e.g. from `glibc`) - then yes, program and all libraries will use the single heap.

If library uses `mmap` directly, it can allocate memory which is not the memory used by program itself.

If function from .so calls malloc, this malloc is the same as malloc called from program. You can see symbol binding log in Linux/glibc (>2.1) with

So, some library can have own memory manager, e.g. `malloc` compiled with `brk` disabled or with non-malloc memory manager. This manager should have function names other than `malloc` and `free`, for example `malloc1` and `free1` or should not to show/export this names to dynamic linker.
